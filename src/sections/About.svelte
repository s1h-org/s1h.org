    <p class="text-md lg:text-lg text-center pt-4 pl-4 pr-4">
        I'm a software engineer living and working remotely in a small village in southern Bavaria, Germany.
        I'm the happy husband of my lovely wife and the proud father of my son.

        I've been fascinated by computers since my early childhood, but
        initially pursued a career in mechanical engineering and renewable
        energies. During my studies I started teaching an introductory CS course
        for first year students and helped manage our lab's infrastructure.

        Shifting my focus more and more towards computer science I wrote my
        final thesis about a framework for distributed software builds which I
        built with Python. Afterwards, I finally decided to make the switch and
        do my master's degree in computer science at the
        <a href="https://www.fau.de">Friedrich-Alexander-UniversitÃ¤t
            Erlangen-NÃ¼rnberg
        </a>.
